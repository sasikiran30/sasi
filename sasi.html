<p> A.INRODUCTION OF CYBER SECURITY:
 Listed below are the reasons why cyber security is so important in what’s become a predominant 
digital world: 
• Cyber attacks can be extremely expensive for businesses to endure. 
• In addition to financial damage suffered by the business, a data breach can also 
inflict untold reputational damage. 
• Cyber-attacks these days are becoming progressively destructive. Cybercriminals 
are using more sophisticated ways to initiate cyber attacks.
<li>Cyber integrity</li> 
<li> Cyber tech</li> 
<li> Data security</li> 
<li> Network security</li>

<li> B.Cyber integrity:Integrity in cyber security means data is complete, trustworthy and has not been modified or accidentally altered by an unauthorised user. The integrity of data can be compromised unintentionally by errors in entering data, a system malfunction, or forgetting to maintain an up-to-date backup. </li>

<li>Cyber Tech :Cyber technology, also known as cybersecurity or information security technology, refers to the practices, systems, and tools used to protect computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption.</li>
</p>

<p>Data Security: Data security is the process of safeguarding digital information throughout its entire life cycle to protect it from corruption, theft, or unauthorized access. It covers everything—hardware, software, storage devices, and user devices; access and administrative controls; and organizations' policies and procedures.
 
</p>

<p>C:Network Security:Network security is any activity designed to protect the usability and integrity of your network and data. It includes both hardware and software technologies. It targets a variety of threats. It stops them from entering or spreading on your network. Effective network security manages access to the network.
</p>
<p>D. Working:
1. Sensors :
Cyber Security are equipped with sensors that gather data about their surroundings or specific parameters. These sensors can include temperature sensors, motion detectors, light sensors, humidity sensors, cameras, accelerometers, and more, depending on the device's purpose. 

2. Data Collection:
The collected data is then processed by the device's onboard processor or microcontroller. This processing may involve analyzing the data, running algorithms to detect patterns or anomalies, and making decisions based on predefined rules or user preferences. 

3.Data Transmission
Once processed, the data is transmitted to other devices or cloud-based platforms for further analysis, storage, or action. This transmission can occur in real-time or at scheduled intervals, depending on the device's capabilities and requirements. For example, data from a smart home security system may be sent to a cloud server for storage and analysis, while notifications are simultaneously sent to a user's smartphone in real-time.
</p>

<p>E.ADVANTAGES OF Cyber Security:

 <li>Cyber Security enhance convenience by automating tasks and providing remote control capabilities. Users can manage their devices from anywhere with an internet connection, reducing the need for manual intervention.

<li>Enhanced Safety and Security: Cyber Security contribute to safety and security by offering features such as surveillance cameras, motion detectors, and smart locks. These devices enable remote monitoring and alert users to potential threats, enhancing overall security measures.</li>

<li>Energy Savings: Cyber Security enable better energy management through features like energy monitoring, scheduling, and automation. Users can track energy consumption and make informed decisions to reduce waste, leading to cost savings and environmental benefits.</li>

<li>Customization and Personalization:Cyber Security often allow for customization and personalization according to user preferences. Whether it's adjusting lighting colors, setting temperature schedules, or creating personalized routines, smart devices cater to individual needs and preferences.</li>

</p>

<p>F. Performance :
<li>The performance of cybersecurity can be measured in various ways, including:

1. Detection and Response Times: How quickly threats are identified and responded to.
2. Incident Resolution Rate: The percentage of security incidents resolved within a certain timeframe.
3. Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): The average time between a threat emerging and being detected.
4. Mean Time to Respond (MTTR): The average time between detecting a threat and responding to it.
5. Security Incident Rate: The number of security incidents per unit of time.
6. Vulnerability Management: How quickly vulnerabilities are identified and patched.
7. Phishing and Social Engineering Detection: The effectiveness of detecting and preventing phishing and social engineering attacks.
8. Compliance and Regulatory Adherence: Adherence to relevant cybersecurity standards and regulations.
9. User Awareness and Education: The effectiveness of cybersecurity awareness programs for users.
10. Return on Investment (ROI): The financial benefit of cybersecurity investments compared to the cost.

</li>

<p>G. DISADVANTAGES OF Cyber security
<li>One of the biggest drawbacks of cybersecurity is its high cost. Implementing robust cybersecurity measures can be expensive, especially for small businesses or individuals on a tight budget</li>
